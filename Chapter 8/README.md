# Chapter 8 - Authentication, Authorization and Files Handling

In this chapter, we will continue evolving our application, mainly covering two distinct topics: user authentication and file handling.

## How to use this folder?

In this folder, you will find the source code of the chapter.
The filenames are the same as the chapter's sections.

Install the application first by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to start

You need a `.env` file in the root directory before starting the project.
Check the `.env.sample` file to know what to put in it.

You can run the chapter's code by starting the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Trouble?

If you encounter any problems while reading the chapter or while running the code examples, you can ask for help on the [official Discord chat](TODO) TODO LINK
