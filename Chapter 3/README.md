# Chapter 3 - Working with Routes

In this chapter we will learn to expose routes to our application, and how to manage them.
We will understand how the Fastify's router works and how to configure it.

The example we will use is a simple test routes to become confidend with the Fastify's syntax and execution, so HAVE FUN!

## How to use this folder?

In this folder you will find the source code of the chapter.
The filenames are the same as the chapter's sections.

You can run the chapter's code examples by executing:

```bash
node <filename>
```

Before running the code examples, you need to install the dependencies running `npm install`.
