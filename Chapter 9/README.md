# Chapter 9 - Application testing

This chapter will implements the tests for our project by running the application and mocking when necessary.

## How to use this folder?

In this folder you will find the source code of the chapter.
The filenames are the same as the chapter's sections.

Install the application first by running:

```
npm ci
```

You can run the chapter's code by starting the application:

```bash
npm test
```

⚠️ You need a running `docker` application to run the tests.

Before running the code examples, you need to install the dependencies running `npm install`.
